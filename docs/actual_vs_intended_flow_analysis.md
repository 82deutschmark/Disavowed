# Actual vs Intended Flow Analysis

**Author:** Cascade  
**Date:** 2025-06-14  
**Purpose:** Understand the current project flow discrepancies and determine the correct path forward

## Current State Analysis

### Actual Flow (What Happens Now)
```
index.html
    ↓ (button links to /start_game)
/start_game [GET]
    ↓ (renders start_game.html)
start_game.html
    ↓ (form submits to /start_game)
/start_game [POST]
    ↓ (processes form, creates mission)
/game
    ↓
game.html (main gameplay)
```

### Separate Unused Flow
```
/character_selection [GET]
    ↓ (renders character_selection.html)
character_selection.html
    ↓ (form submits to /character_selection)
/character_selection [POST]
    ↓ (stores in session, redirects)
/generate_mission
    ↓ (creates mission)
/game
    ↓
game.html (main gameplay)
```

## Key Findings

### Templates Comparison
| Feature | start_game.html (ACTIVE) | character_selection.html (UNUSED) |
|---------|-------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Entry Point | ✅ Linked from index.html | ❌ No entry point |
| Player Name Input | ✅ Has name/gender fields | ❌ Missing name/gender |
| Character Images | ❌ No images displayed | ✅ Displays character images |
| Narrative Style Input | ❌ Missing | ✅ Added in my redesign |
| Mood Input | ❌ Missing | ✅ Added in my redesign |
| Design Quality | ❌ Basic layout | ✅ Modern, responsive design |
| Loading States | ✅ Has loading animation | ❌ No loading states |

### Route Handler Comparison
| Feature | /start_game | /character_selection |
|---------|-------------|---------------------|
| Handles narrative_style | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (my update) |
| Handles mood | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (my update) |
| Handles player_name | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Session Management | ✅ Full | ✅ Partial |
| Mission Creation | ✅ Direct | ❌ Delegates to /generate_mission |

## Issues Identified

1. **Disconnected Improvements**: The better UX (character_selection.html) is not connected to the main flow
2. **Missing Features**: The active template (start_game.html) lacks narrative_style/mood inputs
3. **Inconsistent Flows**: Two different approaches to the same functionality
4. **Documentation Mismatch**: My design documents assumed character_selection.html was the main template

## Possible Explanations

### Hypothesis 1: Development Evolution
- `start_game.html` was the original simple implementation
- `character_selection.html` was developed as an improved version
- The connection between them was never completed

### Hypothesis 2: Intended Multi-Step Flow
- `start_game.html` was meant for basic setup (name/gender)
- `character_selection.html` was meant for detailed character selection
- The redirect flow was never implemented

### Hypothesis 3: Alternative Paths
- Both were meant to be different entry points for different user types
- The routing logic was incomplete

## Recommended Path Forward

### Option A: Consolidate into start_game.html
- Apply the redesign from character_selection.html to start_game.html
- Add narrative_style/mood inputs to start_game.html
- Update /start_game route to handle the new fields
- Keep the main flow intact but enhance it

### Option B: Complete the Multi-Step Flow
- Connect character_selection.html to the main flow
- Make /start_game redirect to /character_selection after name/gender collection
- Complete the session-based flow through /generate_mission

### Option C: Create Hybrid Approach
- Rename character_selection.html to start_game.html (replace it)
- Add name/gender inputs to the redesigned template
- Keep the single-route approach but with better UX

## Questions for Decision
1. What was the original intent for having two templates?
2. Should we maintain separate steps or consolidate into one page?
3. Do we prioritize the existing flow or the better UX?
4. Should player name/gender be collected separately from character selection?

## Next Steps
Await user input on preferred approach before implementing changes.
